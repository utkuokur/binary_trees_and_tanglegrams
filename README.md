Sagemath programs related to rooted binary trees and tanglegrams

This package contains Sagemath code to calculate:

1- the k-multideck of a rooted binary tree T with n leaves, namely, the multiset of rooted binary trees "induced" by (n-1)-subsets of the leaves of T. (cf. below for the definition of an induced subtree.)

2- the list of k-universal rooted binary trees, namely, the rooted binary trees of minimum size, containing every rooted binary tree of size k as an induced subtree.

3- the number of non-isomorphic induced subtrees of a fixed binary tree. 

The repository contains the first three programs just mentioned. 

These and related concepts are described in the paper:

Abstract: We consider extremal problems related to decks and multidecks of rooted binary trees (a.k.a. rooted phylogenetic tree shapes). Here, the deck (resp. multideck) of a tree T refers to the set (resp. multiset) of leaf induced binary subtrees of T. On the one hand, we consider the reconstruction of trees from their (multi)decks. We give lower and upper bounds on the minimum (multi)deck size required to uniquely encode a rooted binary tree on n leaves. On the other hand, we consider problems related to deck cardinalities. In particular, we characterize trees with minimum-size as well as maximum-size decks. Finally, we present some exhaustive computations for k-universal trees, i.e., rooted binary trees that contain all k-leaf rooted binary trees as induced subtrees.

Relevant Definitions:

1-  A rooted tree is a tree $T$ where a special vertex, denoted by $r_T$, is identified as the root of $T$.
2-  A rooted binary tree is a rooted tree $T$ where every vertex has either no children (i.e., is a leaf ) or two children. 
3-  Let T be a rooted binary tree. For a set $S \subseteq L(T)$, the rooted binary subtree $T[S]$ induced by $S$ is obtained by first taking the minimal connected subgraph $T'$, of $T$ containing $S$, letting $r_{T[S]}$ be the closest vertex of $T'$ to $r_T$, and then suppressing all other degree-2 vertices in $Tâ€²$.
